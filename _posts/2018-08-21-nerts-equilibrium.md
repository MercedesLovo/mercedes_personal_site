The Nernst equation is a fundamental equation in electrochemistry that is named after the German physical chemist Walther Nernst, who formulated it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is crucial in understanding and predicting the behavior of electrochemical cells, such as batteries and fuel cells, as well as biological systems like neurons and muscle cells.

The Nernst equation allows us to calculate the electrode potential under non-standard conditions, such as varying concentrations of reactants and products. It shows how changes in concentration affect the cell potential, which is crucial for understanding electrochemical processes and designing efficient electrochemical devices.

In biological systems, is used to describe the equilibrium potential of ions across cell membranes, such as the resting membrane potential of neurons.  It helps to expresses the balance between the electrical and chemical driving forces on an ion, and may be stated as the equilibrium potential for an ion is directly proportional to the log of the ratio of the extracellular over the intracellular concentrations or:

Em = RT/zF * log([ion outside the cell]/[ion inside of the cell]).

Em= membrane equilibrium  potential

R = gas constant = 8.314472 J Â· K-1

T = temperature (Kelvin) 

F = Faraday's constant = 9.65 x 104 C mol-1


Lets take the case of Sodium. The graph below shows the Nerts equilibrium for different internal and external sodium concentrations.
