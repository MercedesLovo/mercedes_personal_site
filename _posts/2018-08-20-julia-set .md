The Julia set is a mathematical concept named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia, who examined these sets in the early 20th century.

In essence, a Julia set comprises complex numbers in the complex plane that display chaotic behavior when subjected to repeated iterations of a certain function. The quadratic polynomial f(z)=z2+c, where c is a complex constant, is the most commonly studied function for generating Julia sets.

To visualize the Julia set for a specific c, one typically starts with a grid of points in the complex plane and applies the function f(z) to each point multiple times. Depending on the initial location of the point and the value of c, the point may either remain within a bounded region or escape to infinity with iteration. The points that remain bounded create the Julia set for that particular c.

What makes Julia sets fascinating is their intricate and often highly detailed fractal structure. They exhibit self-similarity at different scales, meaning that zooming into a Julia set reveals similar patterns as the overall set. This property makes them visually stunning and mathematically rich objects of study.
