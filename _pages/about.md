## Who I am?

Hello, my name is Mercedes, I am a honduran psychologist living in Spain.
I am a programming and neuroscience enthusiast.

My primary programming language is Python; but I am currently broadening my skills in web development using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Additionally, I am delving into functional programming concepts with Haskell.

I like to use programming to help me with my math learning journey. I think it is a wonderful visualization tool that allows me to intuitively approach abstract mathematical concepts.
I am planning to use this blog to post some of my favorite topics in the subject.

Regarding my interest in neuroscience, it started years ago, during my anatomy and neuroanatomy classes where I was able to see and touch a brain for the first time. It was there that I became really aware of the difference between mind and brain. I could see the physical form, but I had no way of knowing what the mind of the person to whom that organ belonged was.


I also participated for three years in the program of young volunteers for peace, this marked my life, wherever I go I will be a promoter of peace and non-violence.
